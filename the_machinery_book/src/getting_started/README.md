# Getting started

To run The Machinery you need:

- A 64-bit Windows 10 machine with the latest Vulkan drivers
- **Or** a 64-bit Ubuntu 20.04 Linux machine with the latest Vulkan drivers (ArchLinux should also work, no guarantees are made for other distros)
- **And** an [ourmachinery.com](https://ourmachinery.com/) account. [Sign up here!](https://ourmachinery.com/sign-up.html)

On Linux, you also need to install the following packages for the runtime:

~~~bash
sudo apt-get install libxcb-ewmh2 libxcb-cursor0 libxcb-xrm0 unzip
~~~

If you get errors that mention Vulkan or if you see weird rendering glitches, make sure to update
your GPU drivers to the latest version. If that doesn't work, post an issue with our [issue
tracker](https://github.com/OurMachinery/themachinery-public/issues) or ping us on
