> **âš  WARNING: This project is currently a work in progress.**

This repository contains the source of "The Machinery" book and some other books. 

## How to contribute?

If you want to contribute to this project please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first!

## Requirements

Building the book requires 
- [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook)
- [mdbook-toc](https://github.com/badboy/mdbook-toc)
- [mdbook-tera](https://github.com/avitex/mdbook-tera)

To get them:

```bash
$ cargo install mdbook
$ cargo install mdbook-toc
$ cargo install mdbook-tera
```

Alternatively you can download the latest executables for:

- [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases/)
- [mdbook-toc](https://github.com/badboy/mdbook-toc/releases)

## Writing

Edit the markdown files with your editor of choice (we like [Typora](https://typora.io/)). If you want to see the changes live, run:

```bash
# For the_machinery_book
$ cd the_machinery_book && mdbook serve

# For the tutorials
$ cd tutorials && mdbook serve
```

If you want to add new pages to the system just add them to `SUMMARY.md`. As soon as they are in there they will be used for the book.

*About Links*

If you want to link anything within the book please make use of `{{base_url}}` this will be replaced
on build with the correct base URL.

## Building

To build the book, type:

```bash
# For the_machinery_book
