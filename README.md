# The Machinery book

> **âš  WARNING: This project is currently a work in progress.**

This repository contains the source of "The Machinery" book and some other books. 

## How to contribute?

If you want to contribute to this project please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first!

## Requirements

Building the book requires [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook). To get it:

```
$ cargo install mdbook
```

Alternatively you can download the latest executables from this [link](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/releases/).

## Writing

Edit the markdown files with your editor of choice (we like [Typora](https://typora.io/)). If you want to see the changes live, run:

```bash
# For the_machinery_book
$ cd the_machinery_book && mdbook serve

# For the tutorials
$ cd tutorials && mdbook serve
```

If you want to add new pages to the system just add them to `SUMMARY.md`. As soon as they are in there they will be used for the book.

## Building

To build the book, type:

```bash
# For the_machinery_book
$ cd the_machinery_book && mdbook build

# For the tutorials
$ cd tutorials && mdbook build
```

The output will appear in the `book` subdirectory. To check it out, open it in your web browser:
