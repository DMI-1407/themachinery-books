In this section we will discuss some of the Samples in more detail. 

You can download the Physics Sample projects from the Download Tab: ***Help -> Download Sample Projects***

After you have downloaded the Physic Sample Project, you can open it. Its folder structure looks as following in the default view:

All examples are in the folder `Scenes`. When you open that folder, you can see all the sample Scenes (Entities). Double click on the Sample of your choice, and the Editor will load the Scene for you.

Each of the Sample Scenes is composed of multiple Entity Prototypes. You can find them in the "Special Objects" or in the "Shapes" folder in the Asset Browser.

*Special Objects* are entities with Graph Component attached and have the logic with them.

*Shapes* are reused Entities to demonstrate different kind of Physic Bodies.

>  **Note: **If you change any of those Prototypes all the none modified instances will change as well. Keep this in mind when playing around with the samples.
