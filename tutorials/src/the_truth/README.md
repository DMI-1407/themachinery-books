# The Truth

The Machinery uses a powerful data model to represent edited assets. This model has built-in support
for serialization, streaming, copy/paste, drag-and-drop as well as unlimited undo/redo. It supports
an advanced hierarchical prefab model for making derivative object instances and propagating
changes. It even has full support for real-time collaboration. Multiple people can work together in
the same game project, Google Docs-style. Since all of these features are built into the data model
itself, your custom, game-specific data will get them automatically, without you having to write a
line of code.

This section shall introduce you to some more complex topics such as [*How to create your own asset.*](/the_truth/custom_asset/index.html)
